1. Clone this repository into your local file system. There's a big green button above that'll direct you on how to clone a git repository, but it'll look something like this:
    
    `git clone https://github.com/frankalbenesius/spinner`
1. Use your terminal to move into the newly created `/spinner` directory:
    
    `cd spinner`
1. Install project dependencies using "npm" (npm comes with node, it's the node package manager):
    
    `npm install`
1. Run the project on a local development server. In this scenario, "dev" is an npm script we've defined in the project's `package.json`. We are telling npm to "run" it.
    
    `npm run dev`
